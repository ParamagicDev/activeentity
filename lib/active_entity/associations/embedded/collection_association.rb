      # CollectionAssociation is an abstract class that provides common stuff to
      # ease the implementation of association proxies that represent
      # collections. See the class hierarchy in Association.
      #
      #   CollectionAssociation:
      #     HasManyAssociation => has_many
      #       HasManyThroughAssociation + ThroughAssociation => has_many :through
      #
      # The CollectionAssociation class provides common methods to the collections
      # defined by +has_and_belongs_to_many+, +has_many+ or +has_many+ with
      # the +:through association+ option.
      #
      # You need to be careful with assumptions regarding the target: The proxy
      # does not fetch records from the database until it needs them, but new
      # ones created with +build+ are added to the target. So, the target may be
      # non-empty and still lack children waiting to be read from the database.
      # If you look directly to the database you cannot assume that's the entire
      # collection because new records may have been added to the target, etc.
      #
      # If you need to work on all current children, new and existing records,
      # +load_target+ and the +loaded+ flag are your friends.
